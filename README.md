## Purpose of this app
This app was created to be a simple solution to helping beginners train finger placement. This is specifically created for bagpipes, but there is no reason why it can't be used for any instrument. 

## How it works
The app will randomly display notes on the screen, while it is doing this the musician will practice the finger placement of the note. This is especially useful for learning a new instrument. 

## Installation
To install: clone the repository to your local machine. Make sure you have python3 installed. Then, from the terminal: 
``` 
python3 finger-placement.py
```
